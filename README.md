*Brief about the project*
    Keeping in mind that ours is a website that is used by millions, we are constantly striving for no downtime. In such cases, we need 
    tools which can help us resolve issues faster and with minimal resource involvement. Hence we have implemented some features we could
    think of and are planning to add more.
*Features :*
    1. *Monitoring alerts* from live are on slack and shared with all stakeholders in a common *channel*.(Slack API Integration)
    2. Slack bot to help you provide valuable information on finger tips.
    3. You can ask the bot about status of any *LIVE server*.(Zabbix Integration)
    4. Bot can answer the *15 most critical issues* on server at any time.
    5. Bot can give you the contacts, for the project SPOCs listed in *roster* in case of any issues on live(Roster Integration)
    In plan :
    1. Get team's velocity and the performance metrics on the go (JIRA integration)
    2. Get P1s reported for any team in the team specific group
    ... and many more to come
